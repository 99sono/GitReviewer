# Rule Engine - Action Plan

## Overview
This module will implement the core rule execution framework that supports both traditional static analysis rules and LLM-powered intelligent code review.

## Key Requirements from Specifications

### From delete_me/01.md and 12A.md/12b.md
- Implement Rule interface and RuleContext
- Support both structured findings and LLMInlineFindings
- Allow rules to own their traversal patterns (visitor-based)
- Integrate with LLM for intelligent analysis

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Rule Framework
1. Implement `Rule` interface with execute method
2. Implement `RuleContext` with AST, diff, and metadata
3. Create `RuleRunner` service for orchestrating rule execution
4. Add support for rule registration and discovery

### Phase 2: Traditional Rules
1. Implement base `StaticAnalysisRule` class
2. Add AST visitor pattern support for code traversal
3. Create common rule types (naming, complexity, style)
4. Implement rule configuration system

### Phase 3: LLM Integration
1. Implement `LLMRule` interface extending `Rule`
2. Add LangChain4j integration for LLM calls
3. Implement prompt engineering for code review
4. Add LLM response parsing and finding generation

### Phase 4: Finding Management
1. Implement `Finding` and `LLMInlineFinding` data structures
2. Add finding deduplication and prioritization
3. Implement finding serialization and persistence
4. Create finding filtering and aggregation

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
1. Add rule execution parallelization
2. Implement rule dependency management
3. Add performance monitoring and metrics
4. Support for custom rule development

## Rule Categories

### Code Quality Rules
- Method complexity analysis
- Naming convention validation
- Code style and formatting checks

### Security Rules
- Input validation checks
- SQL injection detection
- Authentication/authorization verification

### Performance Rules
- Inefficient algorithm detection
- Memory leak prevention
- Database query optimization

### LLM-Powered Rules
- Code readability assessment
- Design pattern suggestions
- Documentation quality analysis

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual rules
- Integration tests with LLM mocking
- Performance tests for rule execution
- End-to-end tests with sample codebases

## Integration Points
- Consumes AST from `java-parser` module
- Uses diff data from `diff-mapper-core`
- Produces findings for `outputs` module
- Orchestrated by `bootstrap-app`
