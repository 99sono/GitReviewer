# Outputs - Action Plan

## Overview
This module will implement the formatting and rendering of code review findings for various output channels, with a focus on GitHub inline comments.

## Key Requirements from Specifications

### From delete_me/01.md and 12A.md/12b.md
- Implement GitHubInlineRenderer for posting LLMInlineFindings as inline comments
- Support dry-run mode and deduplication via finding IDs
- Handle both structured findings and LLM findings

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Rendering Framework
1. Implement `OutputRenderer` interface hierarchy
2. Create `FindingFormatter` for consistent formatting
3. Add support for different output formats (GitHub, console, file)
4. Implement basic comment formatting

### Phase 2: GitHub Integration
1. Implement `GitHubInlineRenderer` for PR comments
2. Add support for inline comment positioning
3. Implement comment threading for complex findings
4. Add support for code suggestions in comments

### Phase 3: Deduplication System
1. Implement `DeduplicationService` using finding IDs
2. Add finding comparison and merging logic
3. Support for finding updates and replacements
4. Implement persistence for deduplication state

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Add dry-run mode for testing
2. Implement batch comment posting
3. Add support for comment reactions and replies
4. Create configurable output templates

### Phase 5: Multiple Output Formats
1. Implement console output renderer
2. Add HTML report generation
3. Create JSON export functionality
4. Support for custom output formats

## Output Channels

### GitHub Comments
- Inline comments with line positioning
- Support for multi-line suggestions
- Threaded conversations for discussions
- Emoji reactions for quick feedback

### Console Output
- Color-coded severity levels
- Formatted text with file locations
- Summary statistics and reports
- JSON output option for automation

### File Reports
- HTML reports with syntax highlighting
- JSON exports for integration
- CSV exports for data analysis
- PDF reports for documentation

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for formatting logic
- Integration tests with GitHub API mocking
- End-to-end tests with sample findings
- Performance tests for large finding sets

## Integration Points
- Consumes findings from `rule-engine`
- Works with `github-connector` for posting
- Used by `bootstrap-app` for output rendering
