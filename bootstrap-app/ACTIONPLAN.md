# Bootstrap App - Action Plan

## Overview
This module will implement the main Spring Boot application that orchestrates the entire code review workflow, integrating all other modules.

## Key Requirements from Specifications

### From delete_me/01.md and 12A.md/12b.md
- End-to-end orchestration: fetch PR, filter files, build mappings, parse ASTs, run rules, queue findings, post comments
- In-memory queue for MVP; add persistence later
- Support for dry-run mode

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Application Setup
1. Create Spring Boot main application class
2. Set up basic configuration and profiles
3. Implement health check endpoints
4. Add logging and monitoring configuration

### Phase 2: Core Orchestration
1. Implement `CodeReviewService` for main workflow
2. Create `PullRequestProcessor` for PR event handling
3. Add `CodeAnalysisOrchestrator` for coordinating analysis
4. Implement workflow state management

### Phase 3: REST API
1. Create `CodeReviewController` with PR review endpoints
2. Add webhook endpoint for GitHub integration
3. Implement status and health check endpoints
4. Add configuration endpoints

### Phase 4: Integration Layer
1. Integrate with `github-connector` for PR data
2. Connect to `java-parser` and `diff-mapper-core`
3. Wire up `rule-engine` for analysis
4. Link to `outputs` for result formatting

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
1. Add asynchronous processing for large PRs
2. Implement caching for performance
3. Add metrics and monitoring
4. Support for multiple Git providers

## Application Architecture

### Main Components
- **Web Layer**: REST controllers for external APIs
- **Service Layer**: Business logic orchestration
- **Integration Layer**: Module coordination
- **Configuration Layer**: Settings and profiles

### Workflow Steps
1. Receive PR webhook or manual trigger
2. Fetch PR data and diff from GitHub
3. Filter modified files for analysis
4. Parse AST for each modified file
5. Map diff changes to AST nodes
6. Execute rules against modified code
7. Collect and deduplicate findings
8. Format findings for output
9. Post comments to GitHub PR

## Configuration Management
- Environment-specific settings
- GitHub authentication configuration
- Rule engine configuration
- Output formatting preferences

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual services
- Integration tests for module interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete workflow
- Performance tests for scalability

## Deployment Considerations
- Docker containerization
- Kubernetes deployment manifests
- Health checks and monitoring
- Logging aggregation

## Integration Points
- Orchestrates all other modules
- Provides external API interface
- Manages application lifecycle
