# GitHub Connector - Action Plan

## Overview
This module will implement GitHub API integration for fetching pull request data and posting review comments. It will serve as the external interface for the code review system.

## Key Requirements from Specifications

### From delete_me/04.md
- Implement GitHubPullRequestServiceImpl using Hub4J for PR snapshots
- Handle authentication, rate limiting, and error handling
- Support posting inline comments on pull requests
- Integrate with webhook system for automated reviews

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core GitHub Client
1. Implement `GitHubClient` wrapper around Hub4J GitHub API
2. Add authentication support (personal access tokens, GitHub Apps)
3. Implement rate limiting handling with exponential backoff
4. Add connection pooling and timeout configuration

### Phase 2: Pull Request Service
1. Implement `GitHubPullRequestServiceImpl`
2. Add method to fetch PR snapshots with diff data
3. Support for fetching file contents and commit history
4. Handle large PRs with pagination

### Phase 3: Comment Posting
1. Implement `CommentPoster` service for inline comments
2. Support for posting findings as review comments
3. Handle comment deduplication and updates
4. Add support for batch comment posting

### Phase 4: Webhook Integration
1. Implement webhook endpoint for PR events
2. Add webhook signature verification for security
3. Support for automated review triggers
4. Handle webhook retry logic

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
1. Support for GitHub Apps with higher rate limits
2. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
3. Add support for GitLab integration (future extensibility)
4. Performance monitoring and metrics

## Security Considerations
- Secure token storage and rotation
- Webhook signature validation
- Rate limiting protection
- Audit logging for API calls

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests with mocked GitHub API responses
- Integration tests with GitHub test repositories
- Webhook testing with local tunneling
- Load testing for rate limiting scenarios

## Integration Points
- Will be used by `bootstrap-app` for PR processing
- Receives findings from `rule-engine` for posting
- Works with `outputs` module for comment formatting
